This blog post covers the basics of time-series data and why time-series
databases have seen such an explosion in popularity since the category emerged a
decade ago. Additionally, we will briefly cover the origin story of QuestDB, why
we set out to build a new database from scratch and go through the database
design choices and trade-offs.

## Time series data and characteristics of TSDBs

Time-series data is everywhere. Sensors, financial exchanges, servers, and
software applications generate streams of events, which need to be analyzed on
the fly. Time-series databases (TSDB) emerged as a category to better deal with
a vast amount of machine data. These specialized Database Management Systems
(DMBS) are now empowering millions of developers to collect, store, process, and
analyze data over time. With new time-series forecasting methods and machine
learning models, companies are now better equipped to train and refine their
models to predict future outcomes more accurately.

### Time-series data explained

Time series is a succession of data points ordered by time. Time-series data is
often plotted on a chart where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is a metric
that changes over time. For example, stock prices change every microsecond or
even nanosecond, and the trend is best presented as time-series data.

Time-series data has always been plentiful in financial services with
fast-changing tick price data and in e-commerce/ad-tech to better understand
user analytics. With the rise in connected devices, application monitoring, and
observability, time-series data is now critical in nearly all fields. We list a
couple of examples below:

/>

Time-series data has several unique characteristics:

- The amount of data created and processed is large.
- The amount of data flowing from the source is often uninterrupted.
- The volume is also unpredictable and can come with bursts of high volumes of
  data incoming at irregular intervals. This is very common in financial
  markets, with spikes of trading volume occurring after events, which are
  difficult to predict.
- Fresh data needs to be analyzed on the fly. Anomaly detection is a good
  example.

With the rise of time-series data, time series has been the fastest-growing
database category for the past five years according to
[DB-engines](https://db-engines.com/de/ranking/time+series+dbms).

### Time-series databases design

As use cases and the need for time series analysis are increasing exponentially,
so is the amount of raw data itself. To better cope with the ever-growing amount
of data, time-series databases emerged a decade ago. They focus on performance
with fast ingests to process a higher number of data points. The trade-off is
less stringent consistency guarantees, which are typically must-haves for OLTP
workloads. It is pretty common for time-series databases not to be ACID
compliant. Unlike traditional databases in which older data entries are
typically updated with the most recent data point to show the latest state,
time-series databases continuously accumulate data points over time. This way,
one can draw insights from the evolution of metrics to conclude meaningful
insights from the data. This is why TSDBs are optimized for write operations
rather than updates. Once the data is stored in a database, most use cases
require querying this data in real-time to uncover insights on the data quickly.
DevOps teams will set real-time alerts to detect anomalies in server metrics
such as CPU or memory. E-commerce websites need to understand buyers’ behavior
to gather new insights and optimize their stock. A fintech company will want to
detect fraud as transactions occur.

### Time-series databases' most important features and trade-offs

Time-series databases are not optimized for OLTP workloads that typically
include lots of regular update and delete operations. Those are better handled
by relational databases such as PostgreSQL or MySQL. In contrast, time-series
data is mostly an append-only workload with delete operations performed in
batches on less recent data. In time series, we are concerned the most about the
recent data coming in that is being analyzed on the fly. To better cater to
these needs, time-series databases pack a set of features that makes them stand
out from relational databases and other types. We provide a list of these
must-have features for a TSDB. Then, we show how you can do this on QuestDB, an
open-source time-series database with fast ingests and SQL queries. You can run
the examples on the [QuestDB demo site](https://demo.questdb.io/) to check the
query performance.

- **Automated partitioning management**

  Time partitions are created automatically as data arrives. In QuestDB, data is
  partitioned by time (hourly, daily, weekly or monthly).
  [Slicing the data by time partitions](/docs/concept/partitions/) makes
  time-based queries more efficient. Time-based queries will only lift the
  relevant time partitions from the disk rather than lifting the entire dataset.
  Partitioning also allows having multiple tiers of storage, where older
  partitions can be mounted into cold storage, which is cheaper and slower.

- **Downsampling and interpolation**

  Representing the data with a lower frequency. For example, shifting from a
  daily view to a monthly view. In order to facilitate such queries with SQL and
  make them less verbose, QuestDB built a native extension to ANSI SQL with the
  keyword [`SAMPLE BY`](/docs/reference/sql/sample-by). This SQL statement
  slices the dataset by a time interval (15 minutes in our example below) and
  runs aggregations for that time period. We can optionally fill values for
  those periods for which we have no results (interpolation, fill with null,
  default, etc.)

  ```questdb-sql title="Running the VWAP of Bitcoin for every 15 minutes interval in the past day"
  SELECT
      timestamp,
      sum(price * amount) / sum(amount) AS vwap_price,
      sum(amount) AS volume
  FROM trades
  WHERE symbol = 'BTC-USD' AND timestamp > dateadd('d', -1, now())
  SAMPLE BY 15m ALIGN TO CALENDAR;
  ```

- **Interval search**

  Fast retrieving data over arbitrary intervals. For example, zooming into a
  specific timeframe preceding a monitoring alert to better understand the
  underlying cause in real-time. QuestDB’s
  [`WHERE` filter](/docs/reference/sql/where/#symbol-and-string) and
  [`IN` time modifier](/docs/reference/sql/where/#time-range) for timestamp
  search is fast and efficient. The SQL query below retrieves all the data
  points in June 2018 for the column `pickup_datetime`:

  ```questdb-sql title="Retrieving data from the table ‘trips’, where the column ‘pickup_datatime’ happens during the month of June 2018"
  SELECT * FROM 'trips'
  WHERE pickup_datetime IN '2018-06';
  ```

- **Time series joins**

  Align join time-series data from two different tables, which do not have
  exactly matching timestamps. These are known as `ASOF` joins, which we have
  elaborated in the [ASOF JOIN section](/docs/reference/sql/join/#asof-join) in
  our documentation. Below, the two tables, `trips` and `weather`, each show
  values for given timestamps. However, the timestamps for each table are not
  equal. For each timestamp in `trips`, `ASOF` finds the nearest timestamp in
  `weather` and shows the associated weather value in the result table:

  ```questdb-sql title="Example of ASOF JOIN query between the tables ‘trips’ and ‘weather’ which have non-identical matching timestamps"
  SELECT pickup_datetime, fare_amount, tempF, windDir
  FROM (trips WHERE pickup_datetime IN '2018-06-01')
  ASOF JOIN weather;
  ```

- **Most recent first**

  With time-series data, the most recent data is often more likely to be
  analyzed. QuestDB’s SQL language extension includes
  [`LATEST ON`](/docs/reference/sql/latest-on/) to get the most recent view of a
  record instantly. As data is ingested in chronological order, QuestDB starts
  scanning from the bottom and can thus retrieve the data point fast.

  ```questdb-sql title="Retrieving the most recent data points for BTC-USD and ETH-USD prices with LATEST ON."
  SELECT * FROM trades
  WHERE symbol in ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')
  LATEST ON timestamp PARTITION BY symbol;
  ```

- **Streaming ingestion protocols**

  As time-series data is mostly machine data, it is produced and streamed to a
  database in a continuous fashion. The ability to sustain streamed data rather
  than in slow batches quickly becomes a must. The
  [InfluxDB line protocol](/blog/2020/07/22/influxdb-lp-on-tcp) is very
  efficient and offers a lot of flexibility. For example, you can create new
  columns on the fly without specifying a schema ahead of time.

## Why we set out to build QuestDB

### Democratizing time-series data performance

Our CTO worked in electronic trading and had built trading infrastructure for
more than 10 years. In 2013, his boss would not allow him to use the only
high-performance database suited to deal with time-series data because of its
proprietary nature and price.

QuestDB was built with the intention to democratize the performance that was
only available for high-end enterprise applications and make the tooling
available for every developer around the world leveraging an open-source
distribution model. Instead of writing a new querying language from scratch, our
CTO decided to facilitate developer adoption via SQL rather than a complex
proprietary language.

And this was the origin of QuestDB.

We have heard a large number of companies complaining about the performance
limitations of open-source time-series databases. Most of those reuse existing
libraries or are an extension of a well-known database that was not designed to
process time-series data efficiently in the first place.

Instead, we chose an alternative route, one that took more than 7 years of R&D.
Our vision from day 1 was to challenge the norm and build software that uses new
approaches and leverages the techniques learned in low-latency trading floors.
An important aspect was to study and understand the evolution of hardware to
build database software that could extract more performance from CPUs, memory,
and modern hard disks.

### QuestDB design and performance

QuestDB is built-in zero-GC Java and C++, and every single algorithm in the code
base has been written from scratch with the goal of maximizing performance.

QuestDB’s data model (time-based arrays) differs from the LSM-tree or B-tree
based storage engines found in InfluxDB or TimescaleDB. It reduces overhead and
data duplication while maintaining immediate consistency and persisting data on
disk.

This linear data model structure massively optimizes ingestion as it allows the
database to slice data extremely efficiently in small chunks and process it all
in parallel. QuestDB also saturates the network cards to process messages from
several senders in parallel. Our ingestion is append-only, with constant
complexity, i.e. O(1); QuestDB does not rely on computationally intense indices
to reorder data as it hits the database. Out-of-order ingests are dealt with and
re-ordered in memory before being persisted to disk.

QuestDB’s data layout enables CPUs to access data faster. With respect to
queries, our codebase leverages modern CPU architecture with SIMD instructions
to enable the same operation to be performed on multiple data elements in
parallel. We store data in columns and partition it by time in order to lift the
minimal amount of data from the disk for a given query.

We didn't get everything right from the start! In 2021, we shipped QuestDB 6.0
to support
[high performance out-of-order data](/blog/2021/05/10/questdb-release-6-0-tsbs-benchmark/).
A few months ago, we shipped
[dynamic commits](/blog/2022/11/25/questdb-6.6.1-dynamic-commits/) to optimize
ingestion throughput and data freshness for reads. We also rewrote our ingestion
layer to make it more performant — taking advantage of the latest OS kernel
innovations — and released official clients in seven programming languages to
improve the developer experience. We are in the middle of decoupling data
ingestion from table writers to eliminate table locks when using the Postgres
wire protocol. We already have some ideas to make downsampling and aggregation
queries even faster.
